These projects might contain multiple components - from a simple application to a system consisting of HTTP APIs, databases, mobile and web applications. Our projects are most often brand new applications and systems we architect, which allows us to use the latest and greatest in languages, frameworks, and operating systems. Oh, and we really value automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A developer at&amp;nbsp;Stable Kernel&amp;nbsp;works on a 2-5 person team dedicated to a single project. A team consists of other developers, UX/UI designers, and project managers. A typical project takes anywhere from three months to a year. All work is done in our beautiful office in Atlanta, GA with walking access to the BeltLine. Because we believe teams work best when they are constantly collaborating, we do not have remote employees - but we do have a flexible work from home policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about what it's like to work at SK from one of our developers &lt;a href="https://stablekernel.com/the-growth-of-a-stablekernel-software-engineer/" rel="nofollow"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When not working on client projects, we maintain a number of open source (e.g., &lt;a href="http://aqueduct.io/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://aqueduct.io)&lt;/a&gt; and closed source libraries and tools. Developers are able to strike a balance between delivering applications and working on interesting libraries that enable our entire team to operate more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interested? Here's what we are looking for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;1-2 years experience using Swift or Objective-C&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of XIBs and storyboards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Higher-ordered functions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design pattern agnostic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong communication skills&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;An interest in consulting / working and communicating with clients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At SK, we are consultants and an extension of our client's team. We are looking for candidates&amp;nbsp;who have strong communication skills and are interested or comfortable&amp;nbsp;working with clients on a daily basis. We are not implementors, but product strategists, guiding our clients from the start of a project beyond the finish line. Our clients depend on our developers to make the best decision for their needs and being able to communicate efficiently.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to technical skills, you should have a solid understanding of the Swift language. This includes understanding the difference between value and reference types and using higher-ordered functions. You should also have a good grasp on the iOS framework, including how the view and responder hierarchy work, how XIB/storyboard files are loaded, how auto-layout constraints are evaluated. Being able to recognize and use design patterns that are found in both Swift and iOS is important. Additionally, a solid understanding of how HTTP APIs (REST) work is preferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're strict MVC or really like MVVM, you should be able to communicate the tradeoffs of architectural and design choices without involving ego. We require that all code we write is reviewed by another team member (through pull requests), so it is important to be able to both contribute to that process as well as learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond technical skills,&amp;nbsp;we are looking for a well-rounded candidate who is eager to be a team player and learn new skills beyond development. Our team of engineers are expected to write blogs, speak at conferences and participate in company-sponsored events. At Stable Kernel, each employee is a brand ambassador.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2019 18:32:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2019-04-26T18:32:48Z</a10:updated><location xmlns="http://stackoverflow.com/jobs/">Atlanta, GA</location></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">244009</guid><link>https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/244009/senior-software-engineer-b2b-ios-peek?a=1jPEfjCBRSsU</link><a10:author><a10:name>Peek</a10:name></a10:author><category>swift</category><category>ios</category><category>objective-c</category><category>realm</category><category>uikit</category><title>Senior Software Engineer - B2B iOS at Peek (Seattle, WA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Peek makes the world's tours &amp;amp; activities easily bookable &amp;mdash; anytime, anywhere.
